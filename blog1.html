        <h3>About running and jogging</h3> <br>
        <p>Jogging or running is a popular form of physical activity. About one in 5 Australians try running (or
            jogging) at some stage in their life. Running is an appealing exercise because it doesn't cost a lot to take
            part and you can run at any time that suits you.
            Some runners choose to participate in fun runs, athletics races or marathons. If you are interested in
            competing with other runners, contact your local running club.</p><br>
<br>
        <h3>Health benefits of running and jogging</h3>
        <p> Regular running or jogging offers many health benefits. Running can:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p> help to build strong bones, as it is a weight bearing exercise</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p> strengthen muscles</p>
            </li>
            <li>

                <p> improve cardiovascular fitness</p>

            </li>
            <li>
                <p>burn plenty of kilojoules</p>

            </li>
            <li>
                <p> help maintain a healthy weight.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>An inactive lifestyle is associated with higher mortality, coronary artery disease, hypertension and
            stroke. It
            is also a primary cause of most chronic diseases, as the body rapidly adapts to insufficient physical
            activity
            which results in substantially reduced quality of life.<br>
            Regular physical activity such as running can significantly improve mental health, self-confidence,
            healthy
            ageing, and quality of life.</p>
<br>
<br>
        <h3>Running versus jogging</h3>
        <p> The difference between running and jogging is intensity. Running is faster, uses more kilojoules and demands
            more effort from the heart, lungs and muscles than jogging. Running requires a higher level of overall
            fitness than jogging.

            Both running and jogging are forms of aerobic exercise. Aerobic means 'with oxygen' – the term 'aerobic
            exercise' means any physical activity that produces energy by combining oxygen with blood glucose or body
            fat.</p><br><br>
        <h3>
            Goal setting for running and jogging
        </h3><br>
        <p>
            Think about what you want to achieve from running or jogging. Issues to consider may include:</p>
        <br>
        <ul>

            <li>

                Getting fit – if you're a beginner, you should start with brisk walking, progress to jogging and work up
                to
                running. This should take a few months.</li>
            <li> General fitness – mix your running with other forms of exercise (such as swimming or team sports) to
                maximise your overall fitness.</li>
            <li> Weight loss – adjust your diet to include plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables, lean meats, wholegrain
                cereals and low-fat dairy products. Cut back on dietary fats, takeaway foods, soft drinks and sugar.
                Companionship – you could run with a friend or join a local running club.</li>
            <li> Competition – running clubs may offer competitive events. Most clubs have sessions designed for
                beginners
                through to advanced runners. You can pit your running skills against others in fun runs or marathons.
                Many
                community-based running events cater for people of all ages and abilities. Join a local orienteering
                club to
                combine running with the challenge of navigating through various environments.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Running and jogging for beginners</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
        <ul>

            <li> See your doctor for a check-up before you start a running program. This is especially important if you
                are
                over 40 years, are overweight, have a chronic illness or haven't exercised in a long time.</li>
            <li>Pre-exercise screening is used to identify people with medical conditions that may put them at a higher
                risk
                of experiencing a health problem during physical activity. It is a filter or ‘safety net’ to help decide
                if
                the potential benefits of exercise outweigh the risks for you. Print a copy of the pre-exercise
                screening
                tool and discuss it with your doctor or exercise professional.</li>
            <li>Start with brisk walking. Aim for 30 minutes per session. Allow a minimum of 8 to 12 weeks to build up
                to
                regular running. Aim to increase your jogging time each session, and alternate between walking and
                jogging.</li>
            <li> Make sure you warm up and stretch thoroughly before you head out. Cool your body down with light
                stretches
                when you return.</li>
            <li> Make sure you have plenty of fluids and take a water bottle with you on your run. Try to drink plenty
                of
                water before, during and after any activity.</li>
            <li> Allow at least 2 complete rest days per week to avoid overtraining, which may cause injury. Consider
                other
                low impact activities, such as swimming, at least once each week.</li>
            <li> Plan your route. If possible, choose flat, grassy areas rather than hard or loose (such as sandy)
                surfaces
                to reduce the risk of injury.</li>
            <li> Avoid running near roads. This is especially important if you have a pre-existing condition such as
                asthma.
                Vehicle exhaust fumes can increase your risk of various cardiovascular and respiratory complaints or
                illnesses.</li>
            <li> Avoid the 'peak hour' periods to reduce your risk of inhaling air pollution from motor vehicles. If
                possible, schedule your runs for either the early morning or the evening.</li>
            <li> Wear clothing which wicks sweat away from the skin. Dress your upper body in layers of clothing so that
                you
                can take off layers as required.</li>
            <li> Apply SPF 50+ sunscreen to exposed skin areas.</li>
            <li>Buy an appropriate pair of shoes.</li>

        </ul>
        <h3>Health and safety suggestions with running and jogging</h3> <br>
        <p> Suggestions include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li> Make sure you eat a healthy, well-balanced diet.</li>
            <li> Avoid eating directly before going for a run.</li>
            <li> Avoid running during the hottest part of the day in summer.</li>
            <li> Drink plenty of water before, during and after your run.</li>
            <li> Take your mobile phone with you.</li>
            <li> If using headphones, do not have the sound too loud – stay alert and aware.</li>
            <li> Wear reflective materials if you're running in the early morning or at night.</li>
            <li> Tell someone where you plan to run and when you think you'll be back.</li>
            <li> Choose well-lit, populated routes and avoid dangerous and isolated areas.</li>
            <li> If you injure yourself while running, stop immediately. Seek medical advice.</li>

        </ul>
